    <h2>0. Introduction</h2>
    This document aims to get you up to speed with PyBison in the fastest possible
    time, by walking you through the motions of using it, and supporting the explanations
    with an example.<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote><big>
    NOTE - recent versions of flex violate the ANSI standards.<br>
    <br>
    If any of the pyBison examples fail to build, remove the following line from the lex code portion of your scripts:
    <b><blockquote>int yylineno = 0;</blockquote></b>
    
    Also, make sure your system is capable of looking in the local directory when trying to load .so files. If you see any errors like <b>failed to load somefilename.so</b>, just add "." to <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, or
    execute the command:
    <b><blockquote>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.</blockquote></b>

    <h2>1. Procure Grammar and Scanner Scripts</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
    
    The best place to start in building your PyBison parser is to write a grammar (.y)
    script, and a scanner (.l) script.<br>
    <br>
    (Or, if possible, source these scripts from other (open source) projects).<br>
    <br>
    Once you're familiar with the layout of PyBison parser python modules, you can
    skip this step, and start building each new parser from scratch, or fram a template
    (refer to the <b>examples/template</b> directory).
    
    <!--@+others-->
    <!--@+node:1.1 introducing pybison-->
    <h3>1.1. Introducing the bison2py Utility</h3>
    <blockquote>
    
    bison2py munges your new (or legacy) grammar (.y) and scanner (.l) files, and
    generates a new Python file containing classes and unit test code for your
    PyBison parser.<br>
    <br>
    To see <b>bison2py</b> in action, go into the <b>examples/java</b> directory,
    read the README file, and generate a <b>javaparser.py</b> file from <b>javaparser.y</b>
    and <b>javaparser.l</b> scripts.<br>
    <br>
    Study the generated javaparser.py file - it's
    especially useful from a point of view of seeing what's good to put into a pybison
    python parser file, especially when writing your own.<br>
    <br>
    In fact, when starting a new parser project, you might like to start by writing <b>.y</b>
    and <b>.l</b> files yourself, and repeatedly:
    <ol>
      <li>Edit these files</li>
      <li>Generate a parser from them with bison2py</li>
      <li>Test the parser rigorously against a whole range of inputs</li>
      <li>Remove the grammar and scanner errors as you find them</li>
      <li>Repeat these steps as often as needed till you have a bug-free parser and scanner</li>
    </ol>
    
    We suggest you may have a far easier time if you ensure you have a bug-free parser
    script before even <i>beginning</i> to edit your target handler and parse node methods.<br>
    <br>
    Once you've got a stable parser, you'll have a structure to work from. You'll then be free to
    discard or archive your .y and .l files, and tweak the grammar and scanner
    by editing the target handler docstrings and scanner script attributes, respectively.

    <!--@+node:1.2 prepare grammar file-->
    <h3>1.2. Preparing Your Grammar File</h3>
    <blockquote>
    If you're using an existing .y file (perhaps sourced from another project),
    you'll need to massage it a bit to get it into a state where you can process
    it automatically with bison2py.<br>
    <br>
    In summary, you'll need to:
    <ul>
      <li>Eliminate actions and comments from rules section</li>
      <li>Replace character literals in rules, with abstract tokens</li>
      <li>Enclose all <b>:</b>, <b>|</b> and <b>;</b> rule delimiters in whitespace.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>1.2.1. Strip Out Comments and Actions</h4>
    <blockquote>
    With your grammar (.y) file, you'll need to strip out all action statements
    and comments from the rules section.<br>
    <br>
    For instance, if you're using a legacy grammar file, you'll need to convert rules like:
    <b>
    <pre>
        expr: expr PLUS expr
                { $$ = $1 + $3; } /* add the numbers now */
             |expr MINUS expr
                { $$ = $1 - $3; }
             ;</pre>
    </b>
    to:
    <b><pre>
        expr : expr PLUS expr
           | expr MINUS expr
           ;</pre></b>
    or:
    <b>
      <pre>
        expr
        : expr PLUS expr
        | expr MINUS expr
        ;</pre>
    </b>
    depending on what style meets your taste.<br>
    <br>
    The reason for this is that your pybison script will receive callbacks every time a parse
    target is reached, which is done by automatically appending special action code to each
    rule clause. If you don't remove all action statements, the conversion will fail.
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>1.2.2. Replace All Character Literals in Rules</h4>
    
    <blockquote>
    Within the PyBison-generated parser, all targets and tokens are rendered as Python
    objects (for people familiar with the Python/C API, type <b>PyObject *</b>)<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, you unfortunately lose the convenience of being able to deal in C character
    literals in your rules.<br>
    <br>
    For instance, with a rule like:
    
    <b><pre>
        expr : expr '+' expr
           | expr '-' expr
           ;</pre></b>
    
    you'll have to replace the <b>'+'</b> and <b>'-'</b> char literals to abstract tokens,
    and ensure that your scanner script returns Python-wrapped tokens for these operators.
    You should end up with a rule like:
    
    <b><pre>
        expr : expr PLUS expr
           | expr MINUS expr
           ;</pre></b>
    
    And you'll need to ensure your scanner script does a <b>returntoken(PLUS);</b>
    and <b>returntoken(MINUS);</b> for <b>'+'</b> and <b>'-'</b> respectively.
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>1.2.3. Enclose Rule Delimiters in Whitespace</h4>
    
    <blockquote>
    You need to ensure that the delimiters <b>:</b>, <b>|</b> and <b>;</b> delimiters used in
    your rules have at least one whitespace character on either side. Sorry about this, but
    this version of PyBison has some quirks in the regular expressions used for
    extracting/dissecting the rules, and bison2py (or the resultant parser) may fail
    if you don't follow this step.
    </blockquote>
    
    
    And also, you'll need to have a:
    <blockquote><b>
      %{
      ...
      %}
    </b></blockquote>
    section in the prologue (before the first <b>%%</b>).

    <!--@+node:1.3 prepare lex file-->
    <h3>1.3. Preparing Your Tokeniser File</h3>
    <blockquote>
    
    In addition to parse targets callbacks, PyBison has an input callback, so your Parser
    object will have control over the input that is sent to the lexer.<br>
    <br>
    You'll have to set up your tokeniser to use this callback mechanism, and also to wrap
    tokens as Python objects.<br>
    <br>
    To set this up, ensure the following lines are in the C declarations sections of your
    lex/flex script:
    <b><pre>
    %{
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include "Python.h"
    #define YYSTYPE void *
    #include "tokens.h"
    extern void *py_parser;
    extern void (*py_input)(PyObject *parser, char *buf, int *result, int max_size);
    #define returntoken(tok) yylval = PyString_FromString(strdup(yytext)); return (tok);
    #define YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size) {(*py_input)(py_parser, buf, &result, max_size);}
    }%</pre></b>
    
    <b>&lt;quick-diversion&gt;</b>
    <small><blockquote>
    Let's explain each of these lines now:
    
    <b><pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include "Python.h"</pre></b>
    Include the standard <b>stdio.h</b> and <b>string.h</b> headers, as well as the
    Python-C API file <b>Python.h</b>.
    
    <b><pre>
    #define YYSTYPE void *</pre></b>
    
    All parse targets and tokens are actually of type <b>PyObject *</b>, or 'pointer to
    Python object', but neither bison nor flex-generated code need to know this. We'll
    just give them opaque pointers, and <b>void *</b> will suffice just fine.
    
    <b><pre>
    #include "tokens.h"</pre></b>
    
    When PyBison first instantiates any given parser class (and auto-generates, processes,
    compiles, links the grammar/scanner files into a dynamic lib), the bison program generates
    a header file of token definitions, which gets renamed to <b>tokens.h</b>. Your scanner
    script will need this file, so the token macros will be defined and resolved to the correct
    token numbers.
    
    <b><pre>
    extern void (*py_input)(PyObject *parser, char *buf, int *result, int max_size);
    extern void *py_parser;
    #define YY_INPUT(buf,result,max_size) {(*py_input)(py_parser, buf, &result, max_size);}</pre></b>
    
    These lines activate the input callback mechanism. Whenever the scanner needs more input,
    it will call a global function called <b>py_input()</b>, which forwards the callback to
    your Python Parser's <b>.read(nbytes)</b> method.
    
    <blockquote>
    Note that if you want your scanner to use a different source of input (eg, a live TCP socket
    connection), you can override this method in your parser class, or pass a <b>read=myreadfunction</b>
    keyword argument when instantiating your parser (<b>myreadfunction</b> should be a callable
    accepting a single argument <b>nbytes</b>, being the maximum number of bytes to retrieve,
    and returning a string).
    </blockquote>
    
    <b><pre>
    #define returntoken(tok) yylval = PyString_FromString(strdup(yytext)); return (tok);</pre></b>
    
    A macro which wraps all tokens values as Python strings, so your parser target handlers can uplift
    the original input text which constitutes that token.
    
    </blockquote></small>
    <b>&lt;/quick-diversion&gt;</b><br><br>
    
    Defining the <b>YY_INPUT</b> C macro tells flex to invoke a callback every time it needs
    input, so your <b>Parser</b> class' <b>.read()</b> method will have control over what the
    lexer receives.<br>
    <br>
    Now, you'll need to change all the <b>return</b> statements in your token targets to use
    <b>returntoken()</b> instead. For example, change:
    <blockquote>
      <b>
        "(" { return LPAREN; }<br>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    to:
    <blockquote>
      <b>
        "(" { returntoken(LPAREN); }<br>
      </b>
    </blockquote>
    
    Lastly, in the epilogue of your lexer file (ie, after the second '%%' line), you'll need to add a line like:
    <b><pre>
    yywrap() { return(1); }
    </pre></b>

    <h3>1.4. Doing The Conversion</h3>
    <blockquote>
    
    When you're sure you've got your .y and .l files prepared properly, you can generate
    the .py file, which will contain your pyBison <b>Parser</b> class.<br>
    <br>
    To do this conversion, run the command:
    <blockquote>
      <b>bison2py mybisonfile.y myflexfile.l mypythonfile.py</b>
    </blockquote>
    where <b>mybisonfile.y</b> is your grammar file, with bison/yacc declarations,
    <b>myflexfile.l</b> is your tokeniser script, with flex/lex declarations, and
    <b>mypythonfile.py</b> is the name of the python file you want to generate.<br>
    <br>
    You should now see a file <b>mypythonfile.py</b> which contains a couple of import
    statements, plus a declaration of a class called <b>Parser</b>.
    
    <blockquote>
    If your grammar is large and complex, you should consider adding a <b>-c</b>
    argument to the bison2py command.<br>
    <br>
    This will cause the <b>mypythonfile.py</b> file to be generated with a bunch
    of parse node subclasses, one per parse target, and with each grammar target
    handler method instantiating its respective parse node class, rather
    than the default pybison.BisonNode class.<br>
    <br>
    Also, it'll generate a <b>ParseNode</b> class (derived from <b>pybison.BisonNode</b>,
    from which all these target-specific node classes are derived.
    <br>
    This can be extremely handy, because you can add a bunch of methods to the
    ParseNode class, and optionally override these in your per-target node classes. Also,
    override the constructor and/or the existing .dump() method in this class or
    the per-target classes.<br>

    %left NEG     /* negation--unary minus */
    %right '^'    /* exponentiation        */
    
    /* Grammar follows */

            | input line

    line:     '\n'

    exp:      NUM                { $$ = $1;         }
            | exp '+' exp        { $$ = $1 + $3;    }
            | exp '-' exp        { $$ = $1 - $3;    }

    <h3>2.7. Add Rules Callbacks</h3>
    
    <blockquote>
    
    This is the fun part. We add a method to our class for each of
    the parse targets.<br>
    <br>
    For each parse target <b>sometarget</b>, we need to provide a method
    called:
    <b><blockquote><pre>on_sometarget(self, target, option, names, items)</pre></blockquote></b>
    Each such callback method accepts the arguments:
    <ul>
      <li><b>target</b> - string - the name of the target - passed in mainly as
          a convenience for when you're debugging your grammar.
          </li>
    
      <li><b>option</b> - int - a numerical index indicating which 'clause' matched
          the target. For example, given a rule:
          <b><pre>
            exp : NUMBER
                | exp PLUS exp
                | exp MINUS exp</pre></b>
          If we have matched the expression <b>3 + 6</b>, the <b>option</b> argument
          will be 1, because the clause <b>exp PLUS exp</b> occurs at position 1
          in the list of rule clauses.</li>
      
      <li><b>names</b> - list of strings, being names of the terms in the matching clause.
          For example, with the above rule, the expression <b>3 + 6</b> would produce a
          names list <b>['exp', 'PLUS', 'exp']</b></li>
    
      <li><b>items</b> - list - a list of objects, being the values of the items in the
          matching clause. Each item of this list will (in the case of token
          matches), be a literal string of the token, or (in the case of previously
          handled parse targets), whatever your parse target handler happened to
          return previously. For instance, in the <b>3 + 6</b> example, assuming your <b>on_exp()</b>
          handler returns a float value, this list would be <b>[3.0, '+', 6.0]</b></li>
    </ul>
    
    We must now note a major difference from traditional yacc/bison. In yacc/bison, we
    provide <b>{ action-stmts;... }</b> action blocks after each rule clause. But with
    pyBison, the one parse target callback handles all possible clauses for that target.
    The <b>option</b> argument indicates which clause actually matched.<br>
    <br>
    Now, with this explanation out of the way, we can get down to the business of actually
    writing our callbacks.<br>
    <br>
    Our class now looks like:
    
    <b><pre style="color: #808080">

    Note one important thing here - the rules, declared in our docstrings, are <b>not</b> terminated
    by a semicolon. This is not needed (as in traditional yacc), because the rules
    are separated into separate handler method docstrings, rather than being lumped in together.<br>
    <br>
    So don't put a semicolon in your grammar rule docstrings, or Bad Things might happen.

    <h3>2.8. Add Flex Script</h3>
    
    <blockquote>
    
    Finally, we must tell pyBison how to carve up the input into tokens.<br>
    <br>
    Instead of having a separate flex or lex script, we embed the script
    verbatim as attribute <b>lexscript</b>.<br>
    <br>
    <b>NOTE</b> - you should provide this script as a Python raw string (<b>r"""</b>)<br>
    <br>
    We'll use here a simple flex script which simply recognises numbers, the '+',
    '-', '*', '/', '**' operators, and parentheses.<br>
    <br>
    For our lexer to work, it will need a C declarations section with the magic lines:

    <h3>2.9. Write Runner Script</h3>
    
    <blockquote>
    
    One quick last thing to do here - we just need a tiny script (say, 'runcalc.py'),
    to import our Parser class and run it:
    
    <b><blockquote><pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import mycalc
    p = mycalc.Parser()
    p.run()
    </pre></blockquote></b>
    
    There's a specific reason why we do this - if we made our <b>mycalc.py</b>
    script executable, then when we first instantiate our <b>Parser</b> class,
    PyBison will guess a name for the dynamic library to create. If running
    mycalc.py directly, then <b>self.__class__.__module__</b> will be '__main__',
    and our dynamic library would be created with the name <b>__main__-parser.so</b>,
    which is pretty ugly. You could force a name for the library file by declaring
    an additional attribute in the Parser class:
    <b><blockquote><pre>
    bisonEngineLibName = "mycalc-parser"
    </pre></blockquote></b>
    Oh, and don't forget to chmod the script to be executable.

    <h2>3. Run The Parser</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
    
    We're now ready to run our completed parser.<br>
    <br>
    Given that you have created the files <b>mycalc.py</b> and <b>runcalc.py</b>
    in the current directory, and that you've already installed PyBison (refer INSTALL
    file), you'll be set to go.<br>
    <br>
    From your shell, just type:
    <b><blockquote><pre>
      $ ./runcalc.py
    </pre></blockquote></b>
    The first time you run this parser, it might make a lot of compilation-type noises. For example, my aging Debian-based system produces:
    <b><blockquote><pre>
    In file included from /usr/include/python2.3/Python.h:8,
                     from tmp.l:6:
    /usr/include/python2.3/pyconfig.h:847:1: warning: "_POSIX_C_SOURCE" redefined
    In file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:28,
                     from tmp.lex.c:11:
    /usr/include/features.h:171:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
    </pre></blockquote></b>
    All this relates to a bit of black magic which is happening in the background.<br>
    <br>
    The first time you instantiate your <b>mycalc.Parser</b> class, the <b>bison.BisonParser</b>
    base class tries to load the dynamic library <b>mycalc-parser.so</b> (or, on windows, mycalc-parser.dll).<br>
    <br>
    If the library file is not present (or if it is out of date, determined from hashing handler docstrings and pertinent attributes in the class), PyBison attempts to build it.<br>
    <br>
    To build this library, PyBison:
    <ul>
      <li>Rips the static attributes, and handler method docstrings, from the client
          Parser class</li>
      <li>Generates temporary grammar (tmp.y) and tokeniser (tmp.l) files</li>
      <li>Runs <b>bison</b> (or <b>self.bisonCmd</b>, refer source file bison.pyx) on tmp.y</li>
      <li>Runs <b>flex</b> (or <b>self.flexCmd</b>, refer bison.pyx) on tmp.l</li>
      <li>Compiles the resulting <b>tmp.bison.c</b> and <b>tmp.flex.c</b> files to
          object files</li>
      <li>Links these objects into the shared library file <b>mycalc-parser.so</b></li>
    Subsequent instantiations of the class will not repeat this compilation, unless you
    happen to have changed the embedded lex script, or grammar-related attributes of
    your class.<br>
    <hr>
    Getting back to the point - as long as the <b>mycalc-parser.so</b> library built
    and loaded successfully, we should now see a prompt (refer <b>.input(self, nchars)</b>
    method in 2.8):
    
    <b><blockquote><pre>
    $ ./runcalc.py
    &gt;
    </pre></blockquote></b>
    At this prompt, you can type in numbers, or simple arithmetic expressions, and see the
    result get printed out:
    <b><blockquote><pre>
    &gt; 2 + 3
    5
    &gt; 4 + 5 * 6
    34
    </pre></blockquote></b>
    (note that the higher precedence of '*' has applied).

    The <b>.run()</b> method of your parser object returns whatever your handler for

    <br>
    Building a whole parse tree is pretty simple.<br>
    <br>
    Within each parse target handler callback (your <b>.on_whateverTarget()</b> methods),
    you need to create a new <b>BisonNode</b> instance, and store the component items
    (the <b>items</b> argument, or whatever you want to extract from <b>items</b>) as
    attributes, then return this BisonNode object.<br>
    <br>
    Then, with the BisonNode object returned from your parser's <b>.run()</b> method,
    you'll be able to traverse the tree of the entire parse run.

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
    
    Through this document, we have started from scratch, and created and used a
    complete, working parser.<br>
    <br>
    We have presented the options of starting with existing .y and .l scripts and
    converting them to a boilerplate PyBison .py file, versus writing your own
    python parser file from scratch.<br>
    <br>
    We have covered the requirements for building Parser classes, the attributes and
    methods you need to declare.<br>
    <br>
    We have discussed the callback model, whereby instances of your Parser class
    receive callbacks from PyBison whenever input is required, and whenver a
    parse target has been unambiguously reached.<br>
    <br>
    We have briefly discussed how PyBison derives grammar and tokeniser scripts
    from the contents of our Parser class, and how PyBison runs bison and flex on
    these scripts, compiles the output, and links the result into a shared library,
    which can be used in subsequent uses of the Parser to get almost the full speed
    of C-based code, from the comfort and convenience of the Python environment.<br>
    <br>
    And also, we have briefly mentioned how to use PyBison to build up a parse tree
    as an easily-traversed Python data structure.<br>
    <br>
    We hope this document has got you up to speed without undue head-scratching, and
    that you're now starting to get a feel for designing and building your own
    parsers.
